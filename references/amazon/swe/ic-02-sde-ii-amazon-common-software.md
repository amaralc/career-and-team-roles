**Job ID: 2348928 | ADCI - BLR 14 SEZ**

**DESCRIPTION**

Want to help shape how connected devices get to market faster? Join the new initiative Amazon Common Software (ACS) for Devices which launched Feb â€˜2020 ([https://developer.amazon.com/acs-devices](https://developer.amazon.com/acs-devices)). ACS is software that makes it faster for to integrate Amazon Device SDKs into devices that are transforming the smart home and run Amazon services, like Alexa.

As a Software Development Engineer on the ACS team, you will be part of a team that owns critical ACS components, services, tools, and application development frameworks - working on projects that push the boundaries of customer-device interaction. You will engage with an experienced cross-disciplinary staff to conceive and design innovative consumer product experiences. You must be responsive, flexible, and able to succeed within an open collaborative peer environment. You will participate in designing, prototyping, and building solutions to hard problems in the Amazon Devices ecosystem.

As part of your work, you will work closely with Amazon device software teams, product management teams, external partner developers, internal Amazon application developers, and Amazon service teams to drive development from the concept stage to the launch stage.

**Key job responsibilities**

As a Software Development Engineer II, you will:

- Write code: Write code primarily in C, C++, and Python and design scalable, fault-tolerant, and distributed applications. Produce bullet-proof code that is robust, efficient, and maintainable.
- Design is Crucial: Build flexible systems choosing simple, straightforward solutions over more complex ones. Lead architecture of large initiatives in scaling, security, and availability. Continually challenge what exists and explore what should be changed to best meet evolving business and market needs.
- Test, test, test: Our software engineers don't just write code, they also test the heck out of it. You will write unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests and find ways to automate them.
- Troubleshoot and fix operational problems: You will work with other engineers to troubleshoot operational problems and fix them. If you are so inclined, you will also automate troubleshooting procedures and write tools.
- Influence product direction: You will propose your ideas for the future of the space to product management and get to shape the roadmap.
- Hire and mentor others: You will get to interview people for the team and mentor other engineers.
