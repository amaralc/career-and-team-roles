We design, develop, and deploy high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed search systems used by millions of Amazon customers every day.

We’re seeking a Principal Scientist with a deep expertise in Search Science. Your responsibilities will include everything from developing and prototyping innovative machine learning and deep learning algorithms to implementing, testing, and supporting full solutions in a production environment. We are looking for innovators who can contribute to advancing search technology on what’s scientifically possible while remaining committed to creating world-class products.

Joining this team, you’ll experience the benefits of working in a dynamic, entrepreneurial environment while leveraging the resources of Amazon.com (AMZN), Earth's most customer-centric company and one of the world's leading internet companies. We provide a highly customer-centric, team-oriented environment in our offices located in Palo Alto, California.

**Key job responsibilities**

- As a strategic leader, you will identify investment opportunities, develop long-term strategies, and propose, prioritize, and deliver on goals.
- You’ll also participate in organizational planning, hiring, mentorship, and leadership development.
- You will be technically fearless and with a passion for building scalable science and engineering solutions.
- You will serve as a key scientific resource in full-cycle development (conception, design, implementation, testing to documentation, delivery, and maintenance).

**About the team**
Starting in 2009, the Visual Search & Augmented Reality team has thus far launched many visual search solutions on the Amazon App that use computer vision and machine learning/deep learning to help customers complete their shopping missions more easily; multiple internal teams at Amazon (devices, Kindle, Seller services, etc.) also use our libraries and APIs to deliver solutions to their own customers. We are a full stack shop, and our team capabilities cover the whole solution spectrum, ranging across applied science, large-scale engineering services, product management, UX design, and mobile app development for iOS and Android.
