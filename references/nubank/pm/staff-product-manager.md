## About Nubank

Nubank was founded in 2013 with a very simple idea: everyone should have control over their financial lives. We know that building strong and diverse teams to support us in this mission is essential. That's why we have launched an exclusive recruitment for women working in Product areas in senior technical roles or as team managers. This initiative reinforces our commitment to increasing gender representation in our engineering teams and is part of our commitments to diversity and inclusion.

It's worth noting that building strong and diverse teams is one of Nubank's pillars. And we know that this doesn't happen naturally: we need to work every day to create a more inclusive and diverse environment. We are committed to diversity and strive to extend representation and proportionality to all areas of the company. In our job openings, we value diversity markers such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Check out our commitments to gender and racial diversity and our D&I report.

Nubank was created with the goal of freeing people from a bureaucratic, slow, and inefficient financial system. Since then, through innovative technology and excellent customer service, the company has been redefining people's relationship with money across Latin America. Today, Nubank is one of the largest digital banking platforms and fintech companies in the world. Nubank was founded in Sao Paulo in 2013 by Colombian David Vélez and co-founded by Brazilian Cristina Junqueira and American Edward Wible. Today, Nubank is a global company with offices in Sao Paulo (Brazil), Mexico City (Mexico), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Bogotá (Colombia), Durham (United States), and Berlin (Germany).
