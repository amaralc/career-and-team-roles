## Engineering at Nubank
We strive for state-of-the-art software development practices, that currently includes a variety of technologies. While we value candidates that are familiar with them, we are also confident that software engineers who are interested in joining Nubank will be able to learn from our team.

- High throughput jobs and inter-service communication using Kafka
- Continuous Integration and Deployment into AWS
